## About the Indicators API ##

The World Bank Indicators API provides access to nearly 16,000 time series indicators.
Most of these indicators are available online through tools such as [Databank](https://databank.worldbank.org) and
the [Open Data website](https://data.worldbank.org). The API provides programmatic access to this same data.
Many data series date back over 50 years, and can be used to create interesting applications.

The Indicators API provides access to over 45 databases, including:

* [World Development Indicators](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators)
* [International Debt Statistcs](https://data.worldbank.org/products/ids)
